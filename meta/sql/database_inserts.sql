"
Set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs, 
Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet 
is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or 'the spice', a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities.
